# Welcome to Vector Institute's github!

At the **Vector Institute**, we are dedicated to advancing artificial intelligence (AI) research and translating cutting-edge innovations into real-world solutions. 
Our open-source projects reflect our commitment to collaboration, transparency, and the responsible deployment of AI technologies. 
Here, you’ll find tools, frameworks, and resources that empower organizations and researchers to harness the full potential of AI.

## What We Build

Our open-source contributions aim to bridge the gap between theoretical research and practical application of AI. 
We build tools, MVPs, reference implementations and educational resources that empower researchers, developers, and organizations to 
innovate and solve real-world problems with AI. Our projects span various domains and are designed to be accessible, adaptable, and impactful.

Here are a few key projects that exemplify our mission:

### Vector Inference
 [VectorInstitute/vector-inference](https://github.com/VectorInstitute/vector-inference) is a project focused on
providing efficient and streamlined LLM inference on Slurm clusters. It provides a simple command-line interface and examples
for deploying LLMs using vLLM.

### AI Pocket Reference

- The [VectorInstitute/ai-pocket-reference](https://github.com/VectorInstitute/ai-pocket-reference) serves as a
concise and accessible guide to essential AI concepts, algorithms, and techniques. It's designed to be a quick reference for practitioners
and students, covering a wide range of topics ranging from basics to advanced SOTA approaches.

### Reference Implementation Catalog

- The [VectorInstitute/reference-implementation-catalog](https://github.com/VectorInstitute/reference-implementation-catalog)
offers a curated collection of reference implementations for various AI algorithms and models. This catalog provides practical, working examples
that demonstrate how to implement these techniques in code. It's an invaluable resource for those looking to understand and apply AI algorithms
to their problems and datasets.

## Why Open Source?

We believe that open-source AI tools are essential for fostering innovation and addressing global challenges. By sharing our work, we aim to:
- **Accelerate AI Adoption**: Provide accessible tools that lower barriers to entry for organizations and researchers.
- **Drive Collaboration**: Encourage partnerships across academia, industry, and government to solve complex problems.
- **Promote Responsible AI**: Ensure that AI technologies are developed and deployed ethically, with transparency and accountability.
